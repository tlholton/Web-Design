Website Skeleton
============

This is a simple website skeleton. 

You can use it as a starting point to build your own static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The *index.html* page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website if no other page is specified when a visitor requests the site. In other words, index.html is the name used for the homepage of the website.

You can keep your assets organized by placing files with different file extensions in their corresponding folders. For example, place your Javascript files in the **js** folder, your CSS in the **css** folder, and images in the **img** folder.

If you plan on having multiple pages in addition to *index.html*, it may be a good idea to create a **pages** folder. How you choose to organize your website is up to you, but it is best practice to keep things organized in a way that will makes sense to other web developers.
